# 3D-Boids
A project I did for my game AI programming class.

You can adjust the different force factors applied to boids using the on screen UI. Each force has:
- Strength (strength of force)
- Radius (radius for detection of other boids)

There are also debug elements that are toggleable.
- Raycast (Shows the force vector. This is only visible in the editor)
- Radius (Shows the radius of detection for that force)
